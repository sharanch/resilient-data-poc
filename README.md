# resilient-data-poc

Chaos engineering test suite for [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/) running on Kubernetes (Minikube). Validates PostgreSQL high-availability through automated failover testing, replication verification, and write-durability under primary failure.

## What's in this repo

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `postgres-cluster.yaml` | CNPG `Cluster` manifest — 1 primary + 2 replicas |
| `cnpg-chaos-test.sh` | Failover + replication chaos test |
| `cnpg-write-failover.sh` | Write-during-failover durability test |

---

## Cluster setup

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: my-pg-cluster
spec:
  instances: 3
  imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:16.2
  storage:
    size: 1Gi
    storageClass: standard
  bootstrap:
    initdb:
      database: app_db
      owner: app_user
  monitoring:
    enablePodMonitor: true
```

Install the CNPG operator first:

```bash
kubectl apply --server-side -f \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/release-1.25/releases/cnpg-1.25.1.yaml
```

Then apply the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f postgres-cluster.yaml
kubectl get pods -l cnpg.io/cluster=my-pg-cluster --watch
```

---

## Prerequisites

- `kubectl` configured and pointing at your cluster
- CNPG operator installed
- Cluster secret `my-pg-cluster-app` present (created automatically by CNPG)

---

## Test 1 — `cnpg-chaos-test.sh`

Runs a full end-to-end chaos sequence:

1. Writes a canary row to the primary
2. Verifies the row replicated to all replicas
3. Hard-kills the primary pod (`--grace-period=0 --force`)
4. Waits for CNPG to elect a new primary and measures failover time
5. Confirms the canary row is intact on the new primary
6. Reports final cluster topology

```bash
chmod +x cnpg-chaos-test.sh

# Full test
./cnpg-chaos-test.sh

# Skip the kill (replication check only)
./cnpg-chaos-test.sh --skip-kill

# Skip the write (failover only)
./cnpg-chaos-test.sh --skip-write

# Custom cluster or namespace
CLUSTER=my-pg-cluster NAMESPACE=chatops ./cnpg-chaos-test.sh
```

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--cluster` | `my-pg-cluster` | CNPG cluster name |
| `--namespace` | `default` | Kubernetes namespace |
| `--skip-write` | off | Skip write + replication steps |
| `--skip-kill` | off | Skip kill + failover steps |

### Results (5 runs)

```
Run          Old primary    New primary    Failover    Result
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
chaos-7613   cluster-1      cluster-2      2174ms      PASS
chaos-7648   cluster-2      —              —           FAIL *
chaos-7680   cluster-2      —              —           FAIL *
chaos-7713   cluster-2      cluster-3      2437ms      PASS
chaos-7748   cluster-3      cluster-2      4532ms      PASS

* Replication lag on cluster-3 — replica had just rejoined after
  the previous run's failover. Not a CNPG bug; 30s between runs
  was insufficient for full catch-up.

Average failover (3 passing runs): 2979ms
Fastest: 2174ms  |  Slowest: 4532ms
```

All three successful runs confirmed zero data loss on the canary row.
Primary rotation covered all three pods across the run set.

## Test 2 — `cnpg-write-failover.sh`

Runs a continuous insert loop at 100ms intervals while killing the primary mid-flight. Measures:

- **Write outage window** — how long inserts failed or were skipped during election
- **Sequence gaps** — whether any committed transactions were lost
- **Pre/during/post breakdown** — how many rows landed in each phase of the failover

```bash
chmod +x cnpg-write-failover.sh

# Default: 100ms writes, 3s warmup, 5s cooldown
./cnpg-write-failover.sh

# Custom intervals
./cnpg-write-failover.sh --write-interval 50 --warmup-secs 5
```

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--cluster` | `my-pg-cluster` | CNPG cluster name |
| `--namespace` | `default` | Kubernetes namespace |
| `--write-interval` | `100` | Milliseconds between writes |
| `--warmup-secs` | `3` | Seconds to write before kill |
| `--cooldown-secs` | `5` | Seconds to write after election |

### Result

```
CNPG Write-During-Failover Test — wf-8366

  Write interval:   100ms
  Warmup:           3s before kill
  Cooldown:         5s after election

  6 rows written during warmup
  Pod my-pg-cluster-1 deleted at 1773558369957ms
  New primary: my-pg-cluster-2 (elected in 2388ms)

  Total write attempts:  26
    OK:    17
    ERR:   0
    SKIP:  9   (no primary visible during election)

  Write outage window:   1738ms
  Pre-kill rows:         6
  During-outage rows:    1
  Post-election rows:    10

  Rows committed in DB:  17  (of 17 reported OK)
  Sequence gaps:         1 *
  Data loss:             0 rows

  DURABILITY TEST PASSED — zero data loss on committed writes
```

**On the sequence gap:** `BIGSERIAL` sequences are non-transactional in Postgres — a value consumed by an in-flight transaction that dies with the pod is permanently skipped. A gap of 1 confirms one transaction was lost to the crash (expected), but it was never committed so it is not data loss. A gap > 5 would indicate real missing committed rows worth investigating.

**Write outage vs failover time:** CNPG elected a new primary in 2388ms, but the write outage was only 1738ms — the writer raced the election and landed one row during the transition. This is normal CNPG behaviour and demonstrates that the actual application-visible downtime is shorter than the failover time measured at the infrastructure level.

---

## How primary detection works

Both scripts use CNPG's pod labels rather than hardcoded names:

```bash
kubectl get pod \
  -l "cnpg.io/cluster=my-pg-cluster,cnpg.io/instanceRole=primary" \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}'
```

This works correctly after any number of failovers without modification.

---

## Password handling

CNPG uses `scram-sha-256` auth even for `127.0.0.1` connections inside the pod. Both scripts fetch the password from the cluster secret at runtime:

```bash
DB_PASS=$(kubectl get secret my-pg-cluster-app \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode)
```

Passed into the pod via `env PGPASSWORD=` on each `kubectl exec` — no `.pgpass` file, no manual export.

---

## Notes

- The replication check in `cnpg-chaos-test.sh` waits 1 second before reading from replicas to account for streaming replication lag on Minikube. With less than 60s between back-to-back runs, a replica that just rejoined may still be catching up — increase the sleep between runs or bump the lag buffer to 3–5s if you see intermittent replica failures.
- Each `cnpg-write-failover.sh` run drops and recreates `write_failover_test` so results never bleed between runs.
- Failover time is measured from `kubectl delete pod` to the moment a pod acquires the `primary` role label — wall-clock time including Kubernetes pod scheduling and CNPG promotion logic.
